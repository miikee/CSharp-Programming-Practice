# CSharp-Programming-Practice

C# Programming Practice.

The purpose of these files is to learn C# by practicing different programming excercises.

The programming excercises were found at the following webpage:https://adriann.github.io/programming_problems.html.
Each file addresses one of the excercises found one the webpage.  Program solutions are generally not programmed to be the optimal solution.  Instead they are generally derived by trail and error and my own logic to find a working solution.
